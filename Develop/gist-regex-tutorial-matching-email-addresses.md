# Regex Tutorial: Matching Email Addresses

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used to match and manipulate text patterns. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use regex to match email addresses, which is a common use case in web development and data analysis.

## Summary

This tutorial will cover the components of a regex that can be used to match valid email addresses. We'll start by understanding the basic structure of an email address, and then we'll explore how to use anchors, character classes, quantifiers, and grouping to create a regex pattern that matches email addresses.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify the position of a match within a string. The two most common anchors are the ^ (caret) anchor and the $ (dollar) anchor. The caret anchor matches the start of a string, while the dollar anchor matches the end of a string.

In the case of email addresses, we want to match the entire email address and ensure that there are no extraneous characters before or after it. Therefore, we will use both the caret and dollar anchors in our regex.

/^pattern$/

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are used to specify how many times a pattern should be matched. The most common quantifiers are the + (plus) quantifier and the * (asterisk) quantifier. The plus quantifier matches one or more occurrences of a pattern, while the asterisk quantifier matches zero or more occurrences of a pattern.

In the case of email addresses, we want to match one or more occurrences of alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, and hyphens in the local part of the email address, followed by an @ symbol, followed by one or more occurrences of alphanumeric characters and dots in the domain part of the email address. Therefore, we will use the plus quantifier and the asterisk quantifier in our regex.

/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.]+$/

### OR Operator

The OR operator, denoted by the | (pipe) character, allows us to match one pattern or another. In the case of email addresses, we want to allow for the possibility of the local part of the email address containing a plus sign followed by additional characters, as this is a common feature of many email services. Therefore, we will use the OR operator to match either the plus sign and additional characters, or the standard local part pattern.

/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+(\+[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+)?@[a-zA-Z0-9.]+$/

### Character Classes

Character classes allow us to specify a group of characters that can be matched. We can use character classes to match specific sets of characters, such as all uppercase letters, all lowercase letters, or all digits.

In the case of email addresses, we want to match all alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, and hyphens in the local part of the email address, and all alphanumeric characters and dots in the domain part of the email address. Therefore, we will use character classes to specify these sets of characters.

/^[\w.-]+(\+[\w.-]+)?@[a-zA-Z0-9.]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/

### Flags

Flags in regex are used to modify the search pattern. They are used to change the way the pattern is matched. Some common flags include:

i: makes the search case-insensitive.
g: finds all matches rather than stopping after the first match.
m: enables multiline mode.
To use flags in regex, they are usually added at the end of the pattern with a preceding forward slash.

For example, to make the email matching regex case-insensitive, the /i flag can be added at the end of the pattern like this:

/^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/i

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping and capturing are used to group multiple characters together and capture them as a single unit. They are denoted by parentheses () and can be used to apply quantifiers or alternation to a group of characters.

For example, if we want to capture the domain name in the email address, we can group it using parentheses like this

/^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+([\w-]{2,4})$/

In this pattern, we have grouped the domain name part of the email address as ([\w-]+\.) and captured it as a single unit. The second set of parentheses captures the top-level domain name.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are used to match a single character out of a set of characters. They are denoted by square brackets [] and can be used to specify a range of characters or a set of characters that can match.

For example, to match email addresses that can contain digits, we can modify our pattern like this:

/^[\w\d-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$/

In this pattern, we have added \d inside the character class to match any digit.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

In regex, quantifiers are greedy by default, which means they match as much as possible. For example, the + quantifier in [\w-]+ matches one or more word characters and hyphens as many times as possible.

However, sometimes we want to match as little as possible. This is called a lazy match, and it is denoted by adding a ? after the quantifier. For example, to match the smallest possible domain name in the email address, we can modify our pattern like this:

/^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.?)+[\w-]{2,4}$/

In this pattern, we have added ? after the + quantifier to make it lazy.

### Boundaries

Boundaries in regex are used to match specific positions in the input string. There are two types of boundaries: ^ for the start of the string and $ for the end of the string.

In our email matching pattern, we have used both ^ and $ to match the start and end of the email address string.

### Back-references

Back-references are used to match a previously captured group. They are denoted by a backslash \ followed by the group number. For example, to match repeated words, we can use back-references like this:

const regex = /(\w+)\s+\1/;

In this pattern, we have captured a word and then matched one or more whitespaces followed by the same word using the back-reference \1.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and look-behind assertions are advanced regular expression features that allow you to match text that is followed or preceded by a certain pattern, without actually including that pattern in the match. These assertions do not consume any characters in the string being matched.

Positive look-ahead: (?!pattern): Matches the current position if followed by the pattern.
Negative look-ahead: (?=pattern): Matches the current position if not followed by the pattern.
Positive look-behind: (?<=pattern): Matches the current position if preceded by the pattern.
Negative look-behind: (?<!pattern): Matches the current position if not preceded by the pattern.
For example, if we want to match an email address that ends with ".com", but we don't want to include ".com" in the match, we can use a positive look-behind assertion like this:

const regex = /(?<=\w+)@[\w.]+(?=\.com)/;

This pattern matches an email address that starts with one or more word characters, followed by an "@" symbol, followed by one or more word characters or dots, and ends with ".com", but the ".com" part is not included in the match.
