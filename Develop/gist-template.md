# Regex Tutorial: Matching Email Addresses

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools used to match and manipulate text patterns. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use regex to match email addresses, which is a common use case in web development and data analysis.

We'll start by understanding the basic structure of an email address, and then we'll explore how to use anchors, character classes, quantifiers, and grouping to create a regex pattern that matches email addresses.
